Meta Box plugin is a powerful, professional developer toolkit to create custom meta boxes and custom fields for WordPress.

== Description ==

**Meta Box plugin is a powerful, professional toolkit for developers to create and handle everything related to custom meta boxes and custom fields for WordPress.**

The plugin provides a **wide range of field types** and **a lot of options to for each field type**, which gives you unlimited possibility to control and customize the custom fields.

With the extensions, you can easily build meta boxes not only for custom post types (default), but also for **settings page, user meta, term meta**. You can also display the fields the way you want with columns, tabs or groups.

The plugin is built mostly for developers with a little coding, but if you prefer GUI for faster creating custom post types, meta boxes and custom fields, the plugin has extensions for that: [MB Custom Post Type](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mb-custom-post-type/) and [Meta Box Builder](https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-builder/).

== Changelog ==

= 4.11 =

* Code architecture update:
    * Add `object_id` property to the meta box object. Used to connect the meta box to the post object. Not heavily used yet.
    * Add RWMB_Meta_Box_Registry and RWMB_Field_Registry to store all registered meta boxes and fields. Used to future access these objects. Use internally only. 3rd-party code should not use it as it's still experimental and can change in the future.
    * Deprecated RWMB_Core::get_meta_boxes() due to the meta box registry above. This function was made for internally use only. 3rd-party code should not rely on it.
    * Add magic method __get to the meta box object to quick access to meta box configuration.
