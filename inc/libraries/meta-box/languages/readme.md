# How To Translate Meta Box

## Who translates Meta Box? How can I get involved?

Anyone can help by suggesting new translations [here](http://translate.wordpress.com/projects/meta-box/). No need to use a Translation Editor, you can do it all from [GlotPress](http://translate.wordpress.com/projects/meta-box/)!

Once you've suggested a new translation, a GlotPress validator will review it. They will then approve, reject, or change your suggestions. Once your changes get approved, they are automatically included in the next Meta Box release.

## How does GlotPress work?

You can find detailed GlotPress documentation on [this page](https://en.support.wordpress.com/glotpress/).

## Who decides which languages are available? I want my language added

If you can't find your language in GlotPress, [send us an email](https://metabox.io) and we'll add it for you.

== I want to change translations locally. Where can I download the .PO file for my language? ==

You'll find options to create a .PO file and export translations at the bottom of each language page in GlotPress.
